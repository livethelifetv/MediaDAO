# Media DAO

Multi-layer cross-chain DAO built for running community driven media spaces.

## Motivation

Community driven media space would be a powerful resource for any product enterprise. But it‚Äôs hard to build one without decentralization, transparency and simple UX at the same time.

In frames of the hackathon I combined the advantages of Aragon & Waves Protocols, Aragon Connect, Waves Signer, Ride smart contracts, TheGraph & Google Auth into one DAO model.

The implemented innovative DAO model represents the following features:

- Aragon & Connect DAO mechanics power
- all content and views stored on-chain
- instant rewards to content authors for every viewer
- user authorization through Waves Signer or Google SignIn widget (no extensions needed)
- free smart contracts calls for users

This DAO model can be used as a ‚Äúwhite paper‚Äù by any product team to build a strong community. At the same time this product has a thrilling ambitions: potentially, medias of the full country could be ran on top of the MediaDAO fighting for freedom of speech.
